# Star Wars Android Demo App

## Description

Thank you for reviewing my coding challenge. After working on the challenge with SwiftUI first, this was an interesting exercise for me. I implemented the same functionality with mostly the same app architecture, which highlighted the differences and similarities between the two frontend frameworks for me. Although I do have experience with Android and Kotlin development, a lot of the more modern library of Jetpack Compose were new to me, which is why I, again, did not come as far as I hoped during the set timeframe. Because of this, the second tab of the demo app is empty. 

Obviously this app is also missing many other aspects of a "real" app project, like localization, testing, proper UI design, just to name a few. But I still hope that I was able to demonstrate my ideas about how to write a well-structured mobile app, as well as my ability to quickly dive into a new declarative UI framework like Compose (coming from Flutter).

I am looking forward to discussing further questions about this project in a technical interview.
